# 30DaysOfJavaScript
A 30 day initiative to make at least a JavaScript project a day.

## Why? What?
So, after reading about the [100 Days of Code challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.fs6dm4o3t), I decided to attempt something similar to force myself to code at least a project a day. I say force because, without the challenge, I doubt I'd ever cross the activation threshold I need to start coding in JavaScript.

* I've decided to start of with [The Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) on YouTube.

(Full Disclosure : I've never coded a line in JavaScript.)

## Rules
* Make a JavaScript project a day.
* Code made during work does not count towards the challenge.
* The Code must be pushed towards Github daily.
* A daily log must be maintained on Github with links to the project.
* No more than 2 days can be missed. For every day missed, compensation must be made the very next day.
